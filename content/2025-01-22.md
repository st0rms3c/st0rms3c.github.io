##Welcome to My Site

In the coming months I'll be using this space to document and write about various cybersecurity topics and projects of mine. In particular I'll be writing about [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/) content as it retires and anything I found interesting in the process of completing it. I'll be participating on [Vulnlab](https://www.vulnlab.com/) as well.

I also have plans to start working on my own [C2 framework](https://shogunlab.gitbook.io/building-c2-implants-in-cpp-a-primer) (I won't be following this guide, necessarily, but I found it well put together and thought others could benefit from it) so I will hopefully have quite a bit to write about regarding [TTPs](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/ttp-tactics-techniques-procedures.html) and AV/EDR evasion. I already have my own private loader with an integrated AMSI bypass, but I'd like to beef it up, so to speak, and turn it into a full blown C2 with a scripting engine (most likely [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/)).

Aside from that, anything else related to programming or cybersecurity that piques my interest and I feel like writing about will appear here.

I've long had the very bad habit of not publishing any of my research or findings, which has essentially led to me being a ghost; nobody knows who I am or what I've done and I have nothing to back up any claims I could make about what I know or am capable of. That's great for my privacy and has resulted in a (mostly) peaceful and drama free online existence, but it's also my single biggest regret as far as trying to find gainful employment goes.

So here's to this blog... Portfolio... *Thing*... And here's to the future!

Thanks for stopping by.
